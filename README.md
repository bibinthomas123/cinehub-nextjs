## Note
Get the apikey from the [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) create .env file with `API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
I'm still developing it , so it has a lot of bugs and unformatted code.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
